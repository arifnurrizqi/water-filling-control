# Water Filling Control

I made this for a case study at my house, with the case of a water pump filling two water reservoirs.
here I made some local web server switches to control:

- One water reservoir (Toren Kulon)
- The second water reservoir (Toren Wetan)
- Water pump

Wherein the first and second switches are to control the two relays, each of which is connected to a solenoid valve to fill the first and second reservoirs and the third switch is to control the relay which is connected to the water pump.
